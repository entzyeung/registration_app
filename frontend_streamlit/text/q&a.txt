Video Demo Script: AI-Powered Registration System
[Opening Scene: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Entz/council_3]

"Hello everyone! Welcome to my demo of the AI-Powered Registration System, a usecase of AI that can improve the clients/residents' onboarding, and most importantly can greatly improve the data quality injecting to our databases in the future. My name is Lorentz Yeung, and today, I’ll show you what this app can do and the problems it solves. Let’s dive in!"

[Transition to Tab 1: Introduction, pan to the text]

"First, let’s look at the Introduction tab. This app uses advanced AI to streamline the data input process, collecting essential user details like email, name, address, phone, username, and password , etc. It’s inspired by conversational interfaces, making signup intuitive and flexible. The goal? To enhance efficiency and user experience and data quality, especially for public sector applications, it will save plenty of hours of the data analyst and data scientist in the future.

It is not only limited to clients registration, but also can be applied to many other use cases, e.g. booking, comments or opinion gathering, etc. 

"

[Switch to Tab 2: Registration, click "Start Registration"]

"Now, let’s explore the Registration tab. Here, I’ll start a new registration. The app guides me through questions, starting with ‘What is your email address?’ I’ll enter ‘richmondwandsworth@yahoo.come.uk ’ and hit Submit. Notice the real-time validation—AI ensures my email is valid. why this email? because usually a .co, .uk email address can get through regular validation. let's see how the system responds.



Next, ‘What is your full name?’ I’ll input ‘John doe.’ 
It possibly will go through. But it is not right, right? You will be amazed when you see the result.


The address and phone are optional, 
But i am not skipping them. because they are fun to test with.
i will do "r2 123 High Street, London, SW1A 1AA." this time. because r1, ra, this kind of input is hard to catch and correct. The first time i saw it in our Wandsworth and Richmond databases, It took me a little while to figure it out what it is, and ofcourse plently more time to clean it. Let's see if the system will take it. O. it breezed through. But let's see what would happen in the database.

Then it's teh telephone number.
It is also a pain in the neck during data quality control. Let's try +4407442757070. This is also a complicated one. Let's see if it can go through. Again it can. But let's see what is put in the database.


[Continue demo, show Question 5 and 6]

"Moving on, I’ll choose a username, ‘johndoe123,’ and a strong password, ‘SecurePass2023!"£.’ After submitting, the app completes the process, showing a summary. I can edit any field—let’s change the name to ‘John Smith’—and update it. 


[Pan to the "Developed by entzyeung@gmail.com" note]

"This app solves key pain points: rigid, error-prone forms are replaced with a dynamic, AI-validated flow. 
It is scalable,and i do think it can be replicated with Azure's AI platform.


"That’s it! This use case tests AI’s potential in data inputing, and your feedback is welcome. Check it out at https://huggingface.co/spaces/Entz/council_3. Thanks for watching, and stay tuned for more updates! Developed by me, entzyeung@gmail.com, on June 30, 2025. See you next time!"
