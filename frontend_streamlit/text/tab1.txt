Data quality issues have long plagued council databases, burdening W2 workflow teams (e.g. the Assisted Travel Team's dashboard I am working on), data analysts, and engineers with manual cleaning and validation. This pilot explores how AI-driven workflows can address these pain points by streamlining user registration, ensuring accurate data collection, and reducing validation overhead.

* If 403 or other connection errors, it is because the backend server is being spinned up. Please stay patient and try refresh the page every 1 minute. It takes 1-3mins to spin up usually. 2mins is the average; but could take 5mins or more.

### What is this Registration System?
This application leverages **FastAPI**, **LangGraph**, and **AI validation** (**ChatGPT** with **Guardrails AI** and **dspy**) to collect user information (email, name, address, phone, username, password (included only a few for demo purpose)) with optional fields and real-time validation.  It uses real-time validation to enforce formats (e.g., addresses, phone numbers), minimizing errors and enhancing data integrity stored in a PostgreSQL database.

### How Does It Work?
- **Register**: In the "Registration" tab, users answer a series of questions, with optional fields (address, phone) skippable.
- **Validation**: AI validates inputs (e.g., e.g. address formats, phone numbers, will ask for clarification if ambiguous).
- **Data Storage**: Responses are saved securely in a database for review and editing (currently in a PostgreSQL db in another server.).

### Objectives
- Address **data quality** issues by automating validation and reducing errors.
- Enhance **efficiency** in user onboarding processes.
- Explore **scalable**, secure registration systems for public sector applications. The Same logic could apply to Copilot's Agent, and Power Apps.

### Prototype
We encourage you to test the system with varied inputs to evaluate its robustness. You will see the input summary in the end of registration. You will be amazed how the system would prompt you for the better answer if too ambiguous, and how capable it is in standardising and cleaning up the data.
