Data quality issues have long been one of the problems in our databases, and costed data analysts, and scientists lots of time in manual cleaning and validation. This protype is demoing one of the use cases that AI-driven workflows can address this pain point by streamlining user registration, ensuring accurate data collection, and reducing validation overhead.

The video demo is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb4z85aAMT8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb4z85aAMT8)

### What is this Registration System?
This application leverages **FastAPI**, **LangGraph**, and **AI validation** (**ChatGPT** with **Guardrails AI** and **dspy**) to collect user information (e.g. email, name, address, phone, username, password (including only a few for demo purpose)) with optional fields and real-time validation.  It uses real-time validation to enforce formats (e.g., addresses, phone numbers), minimizing errors and enhancing data integrity stored in a PostgreSQL database.

### How Does It Work?
- **Register**: In the "Registration" tab, users answer a series of questions, with optional fields (address, phone) skippable.
- **Validation**: 2 layers, first AI validates inputs (e.g. address formats, phone numbers, will ask for clarification if ambiguous); 2nd traditional validation (e.g. by regex, make sure data comes from AI validation matches the minimal requirements.
- **Data Storage**: Responses are saved securely in a database for review and editing (currently in a PostgreSQL db in another server.).

### Objectives
- Address **data quality** issues by automating validation and reducing errors.
- Enhance **efficiency** in user (e.g. residents/staffs) onboarding processes.
- Explore **scalability**, the Same logic could apply to our Copilot's Agent, and Power Apps.

### Prototype
We encourage you to test the system with varied inputs to evaluate its robustness. You will see the input summary in the end of registration. You will be amazed by how the system would prompt you for the better answer if too ambiguous, and how capable it is in standardising and cleaning up the data. Do check out the my demo video.
